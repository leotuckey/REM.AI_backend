    # REM.AI - Dream Journal and Analysis

    REM.AI is a backend application designed to help users document their dreams and utilize AI to analyze them for patterns and insights. The project is built with Node.js and MongoDB, providing a robust and scalable solution for dream analysis.

    ## Features

    - **Dream Journal:** Users can log their dreams, storing details like date, time, and narrative descriptions.
    - **AI Analysis:** The application uses AI algorithms to analyze the dreams and identify patterns, themes, and other significant elements.
    - **Pattern Detection:** Over time, the application can detect recurring themes or symbols in a user's dreams.
    - **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login to ensure privacy and data security.
    - **RESTful API:** A set of endpoints to interact with the dream journal, retrieve analysis results, and manage user data.

    ## Technology Stack

    - **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for building the server-side application.
    - **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
    - **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas, providing flexibility in storing dream entries and analysis results.
    - **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js, used for handling data validation, casting, and business logic.
    - **AI Tools/Services:** (Specify any AI tools or libraries you're using, e.g., TensorFlow.js, OpenAI, etc.)

    ## Getting Started

    ### Prerequisites

    - **Node.js** (v14 or later)
    - **MongoDB** (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
    - **npm** (Node package manager)

    ### Installation

    1. **Clone the repository:**

       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/your-username/rem-ai.git
       cd rem-ai

    2. **Install dependencies:**

       ```bash
       npm install
       ```

    3. **Configure environment variables:**

       Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

       ```bash
       MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
       JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
       JWT_LIFETIME=your_jwt_lifetime_duration
       EMAIL_USER=your_email_service_username
       EMAIL_PASS=your_email_service_password
       API_KEY_ENV=your_ai_service_api_key
       ```

    4. **Run the application:**

       ```bash
